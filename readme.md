This program will require your full computer and screens :o

It's also interesting that I did not need to pip install mitmdump. It looks like just having it on your computer is good enough :D!

## File Structure

```
|-- 1
  |-- src
    |-- <program>
      |-- <folder>
        |-- ...
      |-- <program>.py
      |-- index.py
      ...
```

## Next steps

- File parser --> parse multiple files at once to grab content
- Database manager --> store items in db + basic functionality
- File to database manager --> run at the same time with the mitm proxy
- Interaction proxy --> control the mouse, screen, keyboard
- Content factory --> product basic images
- Database manager --> store images
- Researcher managers --> run research using interaction proxy + http proxy + database managers
- Decision makers --> run decisions on the types of content to create, hashtags to use, etc.
- API connectors --> programs that connect to apis to assist interaction proxy and publish content
